  <p>For my final project I want to derive a bit from the path of detective fiction, 
    but I will stay on the path of certain mysteries, escapes and pursuits as we have seen them in detective novels. 
    My focus will be on the system of the Underground Railroad, the diverse network escaped slaves used 
    during the 19th century in the United States, and how escapees were helped to find their freedom by abolitionists, 
    free people and other anti-slavery supporters.
    In the system of the Underground Railroad safehouses, also called “stations”, were set up on the road from the South to the North
    and when discovered had to be moved to other locations. For my project I want to use the locations of known safehouses and escape routes 
    to create a map with the situations in the 19th century when the Underground Railroad was active and more contemporary maps. 
    For this project I will most likely will use Qgis or other Geographical Information System tools and software to visualize
    the Underground Railroad system and show what has changed in the last two centuries.</p>
